We may not want to expose all the information.
Adding Spring Security to project and endpoints are secured.


We need to add this dependency to the POM file.
<dependency>
    <groupId> org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>


We can add these props into our application.properties file.
spring.security.user.name = rameez
spring.security.user.password = khalil


EXCLUDE ENDPOINTS.
management.endpoints.web.exposure.exclude = health etc.
