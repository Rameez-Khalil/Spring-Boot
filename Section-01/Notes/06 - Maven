MAVEN:
    Maven is a project management tool.
    It is used for build management and dependencies.
    It will fetch the JAR files available for us.


We will provide our list, maven will go out and fetch the listed dependencies
from maven central repository.


MAVEN WORKING:
1. Read config file.
2. Maven will check the local repo.
3. If not found, then maven will go out and seek those dependencies
in its central repo, fetching the dependencies and making those available for us.
4. Pushing those JAR files into the local repo.
5. Build and run.


HANDLING JAR DEPENDENCIES:
    1.  Maven will make sure the dev-dependencies are also being downloaded.
    2.  Since spring depends on commons-loggings, maven will make sure to download this as well.

BUILD AND RUN:
    1. Maven will handle the build path.
    2. Based on the POM (Project object model) maven will add JAR files accordingly.
