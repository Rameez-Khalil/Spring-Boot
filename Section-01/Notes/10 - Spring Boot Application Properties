By default spring boot looks for files under application.properties
    we can add server.port = 8585 and this will change the host# 8585.

We can add many properties as we like.


READING PROPERTIES:
    1. We can read these properties through injection.
    2. Inside Rest Controller

        @Value ("${coach.name}")
        private String name;

STATIC PROPERTIES:
    1. Static content - HTML files, JS files etc.

TEST:
