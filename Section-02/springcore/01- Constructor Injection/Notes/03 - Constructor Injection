In our case we first created our Interface to define the methods to be override.
We then created our cricketcoach class to implement the interface's methods.
We then initialized our RestController(DemoController) and in there,
we made use of auto-wiring through constructor and we delegated that task to the Coach.


SPRING BTS:
    Spring will create the objects for Coach.
    Spring will initializes the objects.

    Coach theCoach = new CricketCoach();
    DemoController demoController = new DemoController(theCoach);
