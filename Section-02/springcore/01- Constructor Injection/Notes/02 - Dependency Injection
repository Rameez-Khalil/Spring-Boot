Dependency Injection:
    Works on the basis of dependency inversion principle,
    the client delegates to another object the responsibility of providing
    its dependencies.



    Constructor Injection:
        1. When you have required dependencies.

    Setter Injection:
        1. When you have optional dependencies.
        2. If there is no such dependency, then the app can provide
        reasonable default logic.


SPRING AUTO-WIRING:
    Spring will look for class that matches.



Define dependency interface and class.
Create rest controller.
Create constructor in your class for injections.
Add @GetMapping for /dailyworkouts.



@Component -
    This makes this component a spring bean and makes it available for
    dependency injection .
